                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am a sophomore at Texas A&M majoring in
                        computer science with a minor in embedded system design. I am an officer for the
                        A&M branch of <a href="https://women.acm.org/">ACM-W</a>, Aggie Women in Computer Science (<a href="https://www.awics.org">AWiCS</a>) and I am involved in
                        many other students groups on campus, such as Dance Arts Society and Hullabaloo Band.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Outside of school, I enjoy painting, reading, cooking/baking, dance, and tinkering with Raspberry Pis.
                        Though all of those are generally indoor activities, I like to spend a fair amount of time outdoors, whether
                        that be running, hiking, or just sitting by the pool at my apartment.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After I graduate, I hope to move back to my home area of Washington D.C. or along the East Coast to spend more time 
                        with my three siblings and my family. 
                        While I don't have a specific company or focus area in computer science that I'd like to pursue at this time,
                        I hope to work on a project or team that showcases the "magic" of technology to the world. 
                    </p>
